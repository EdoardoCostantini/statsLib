	A good starting point for your journey into Bayesian Statistics. The book strikes a good balance between 
	rigorous presentation of the material and easy-to-grasp examples. Furthermore, most of the chapters
	are accompanied by R code that reduces to a minimum the abstraction level of the concepts presented.
