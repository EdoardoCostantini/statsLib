	Collins \textit{et al} investigate the effects of an inclusive \textit{vs} a restrictive strategy to the use of
		auxiliary vairables in the missing data handling model of either a ML (maximum likelihood) 
		or MI (Multiple Imputation) approach. \\

	The authors distinguish between three categories of auxiliary vairables (depending on their 
		correlation with the variable(s) with missing values of interest and the missingness 
		mechanism). \\
	
	Thorugh 4 different simulation setups, the they provide insights on the consequences of including
		or excluding auxiliabry variables, from each of these categories, and ultimetly provide compelling
		evidence to prefer an inclusive strategy. \\

	An interesting point is raised regarding the ease of implementation of the inclusive strategy. In particular, 
		the authors point out that, while the inclusion of auxiliary variables is straightforward in the MI 
		framework, current (up to 2001) softwere implementations of ML methods do no facilitate it. This topic 
		is thoroughly explored by Graham (2003). \\

	A final point stressed by the article is that these effects heavely depend on the type of MAR. For 
		example, in their simulations Collins \textit{et al} found that the estiamted mean of a variable 
		Y of interest was biased when the auxiliary vairable Z was excluded from the data handling model, if the 
		probability of missingess was linearly related to Z (MAR-linear); however, that was not the case when 
		the probability of missigness was larger for extreme values of Z or a function of the correlation 
		between Z and Y.

	The author effectively showed thorugh multiple

		handling and analysing datasets with missing data points, can be done relativly easly

	With this paper, Graham introduced the \textit{Saturated Correlated model} and 
		\textit{the extra dv model} to include auxiliary vairbales in a SEM model. Ultimately,
		he showed that it is possible to include auxiliary vairables in a ML missing data 
		handling procedure, without affecting the substantive model (that is to say obtaining 
		the same parameter estimates, standard errors, and estimates of quality of fit).

	In this work, Rubin reviews the state of multiple imputation 18 years after the publication 
		of his seminal works published in 1976 and 1978. This paper clarifies the two
		main goals that Multiple Imputation was designed to achieve: the basic objective 
		of allowing the data ultimate users to apply the same analytical methods as if 
		the data had been complete; and the supplemental objective of granting analyses that 
		are statistically valid for a scientifc estimand. \\

	The concept of statistcal validity is operationalised with clarity by distinguishing between 
		two specification: randomization validity and confidence validity. \\

	Furthermore, the concept of \textit{proper} mulitple imputation is exapanded upon by 
		summarizing its main requirements. \\
	
	Finally some criticisms to MI are addressed through these concepts.

	{
	This article provides a short yet insightgul review of the Missing Information 
		Principle (an interested reader may want to consult Orchard and Woodbury (1972)
		for a more technical presentation of the same concept). According to it, 
		the missing information for a parameter estimation due to missing cases is equal to the difference
		between the complete-data information matrix and the observed-data information matrix. \\

	Subsequently, the definition of the Fraction of Missing Information (FMI) is exploared
		under both the Maximum Likelihood and the Multiple Imputation framework. The 
		fundamental contribution of this paper is showing how FMI is not a prerogative
		of MI. \\

	A final contribution is a detailed discussion of three different possible interpretations
		of FMI: (relative) loss of (estimation) efficacy, loss of statistical power;
       		width inflation factor (i.e. how much bigger are the confidence intervals).

	White's contribution provides some useful comparative guidelines and 
	recommendations on different aspects of MI:
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Handling different dependent variable distirbutions/natures. In particular, there is
		a helpful section dealing with how to handle imputation for skewed continuous vairables.
	
		\item Variable selection - What to include and, more importantly hot to include 
		all the variables of the analysis model in the imputation model (i.e. allowing for 
		qudratic terms and interactions).  Three main ways of doing so are presented 
		(i.e. passive apporach, improved passive apporach using PMM, 
		and JAV).  Altought this section does provide a good comparative overview of the 
		methods, it is not particularly helpful in describing the methods for a novice audience.
		Better resources that do accomplish such task are: INSERT REF HERE.
		
		\item Number of imputations – The authors criticize the \textit{efficiency argument} (that
		usually leads to the rule of thumb  \textit{m} = 5 is adequate for FMI $\leq$ .25) thorguh
		the \textit{replicability argument}, centering the discussion around the decision of \textit{m}
		in terms of Monte Carlo errors. The authros's rule of thumb is that \textit{m} $\geq$ of 
		incomplete cases.
		
		\item Limitations and pitfalls of MI – Apart from the lack of theoretical background,
		the authors discuss the following pitfalls: perfect prediction (potentially a problem
		when the dependent variable is categorical); sensitivity to MAR violation, non-convergence 
		issues; and the problem of too many variables.

	Algorithms to perform Multiple Imputation by FCS with different types
		of dependent vairables are presented in Appendix A of this paper.
		Appendix B describes a method to generate nonmonotone multivariate
		missing data under MAR. \\

	In the main text, after a concise introduction to imputation by FCS, a brief but rigorous 
		definition of \textit{compatibility} between conditonal distributions is given in 
		this paper. A good technical complement for an interested read is 
		Arnold (2001). Simulations and study cases are then discussed 
		in detail for both univariate and multivariate cases, accounting for different
		variable types (i.e. continous, dichotomous, and polytomous). These studies
		highlight the performances of FCS multiple imputation as compared to 
		complete-case analysis in terms of bias and coverage of the confidence intervals. \\

	Furthermore, a simulation study is performed to assess the consequences of (in)compatibility.
		This is just an exemplifying scenario: not all possibile incompatibility schemes can
		be considered. Yet, it does provide compelling evidence in favor of FCS being 
		robust to (clear) incompatibility.

	Transformed variables such as squared and interaction terms need special attention
		when Multiple Imputation is performed. This article compares two main methods
		to impute them: the \textit{transform then impute} and the \textit{impute then transform} 
		approach. \\

	Through extreme missing data scenarios (100\% missignes), and example data analyses, the author
		shows that the \textit{transform then impute} method is the one that best preserves
		the mean and covariance structure of the original data and provides unbiased point
		estimates of regression estimates. As a result, he strongly reccomends such method. \\

	Some variants of these methods are included in the comparison, namely \textit{passive imputation},
       		a more sophisticated but equally flawed version of the \textit{impute then transform} appraoch.	
		and \textit{stratify, then impute} for interactions between categorical and a continuous
		variables. \\

	The main setup considered in this study is that of a linear regression model fitted to a
		dataset with MAR missing data. However, the author adresses the extension of
		the claims to models for binary dependent variables.
