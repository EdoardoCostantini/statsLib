	The book offers a more in-depth discussion of most (and more) of the methods of James et al (2013).

	A great introduction to statistical learning. The book covers the basics of all the fundamental statistical
	learning techniques: linear and logistic regression (with related subset selection, regularisation, dimension
	reduction, etc.), classification tasks, polynomial regression, splines, local regression, generalised additive models,
	trees, SVM. It focuses on supervised learning as it only discusses two unsupervised techniques: 
	PCA and K-means (Chapter 10). \\
	
	Each chapter is supplemented with extensive lab sessions (with R code!) that
	show how to apply the methods. \\
	
	Check out the 
	\href{	https://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/}{online lectures} 
	that accompany the book (section by section!).
