  	This is a very accessible book that, to some extent, does cover technical details 
		of missing data handling strategies in an approachable way. The following 
		topics are explored by this resource:

	\begin{itemize}

		\item \textbf{Missing data mechanisms} - The explanation of 
			the mechanisms is a very approachable and non-technical. 
			However, the book provides an in depth, at least compared to other 
			resources, guide on how to test for MCAR mechanism.
			
	 	\item \textbf{Traditional missing data handling strategies} - Chapter 2 is
	       		entirely dedicated to describing traditional methods for dealing with 
			missing data methods and their problems (e.g. biasing estimates, 
			reduction of SE).

		\item \textbf{Maximum Likelihood Missing Data Handling} - The 
			book dedicates chapter 4 to the detailed description of 
			this handling technique (see also chapter 3 for a good 
			overview of Maximum Likelihood estimation in general).

		\item \textbf{Multiple Imputation} - The discussion of multiple 
			imputation is mainly divided into two chapters, 7 and 8, 
			where the author describes the imputation, and the analysis 
			and pooling phases, respectively. The imputation 
			phase is described according to the \textbf{data augmentation 
			algorithm}\footnote{There is a some confusion on how the use 
			of this term to refer to the this imputation algorithm. In 
			particular it did not seem to be consistent with how van Buuren (2012)
			used it. Pay attention to this in future readings}. Great 
			attention is payed to the Bayesian nature of this algorithm 
			(there is even an introductory chapter on Bayesian statistics).
			The pooling phase sections describes the pooling of point estimates 
			(section 8.3) and standard errors (section 8.5), along with multiple 
			parameters significance testings (D1, D2, etc. [see sections 8.11 through 8.13]).

		\item Chapter 2 -  The chapter discusses at length the assumption of ignorability 
			of the missing data mechanism and its implications 
			for the missing data handling procedures. We talk about ignorable 
			missingness when both the probability model for the missingness does not
			depend on the missing part of the dataset (\textit{MAR}), and the model parameters are
			\textit{distinct} from the missing data model parameters (i.e. knowing 
			one will provide little or no information on the other)

    This book is practically a technical companion to the R package that implements
    the MICE algorithm.

    \begin{itemize}
    
        \item Missing data mechanisms are described through probability models for 
		a missing data indicator variable, as introduced by Rubin (1976) (see sections 1.2 and 2.2).
	       	The concept of ignorability is also precisely defined in section 2.2.5 
		and 2.2.6 [see also 6.2].
		A guide to \textbf{generating MAR} data is presented in section 3.2.4 
		(bivariate) and 3.2.5 (multivariate missingness).
        
        \item \textbf{Missing data handling techniques} - The bulk of the book is focused 
		on multiple imputation methods (maximum Likelihood is not discussed, and 
		very little space is dedicated to traditional methods on ad hoc solutions 
		[see section 1.3]), and in particular to the MICE algorithm. \\
        	Multiple Imputation is discussed first in the case of univariate missingness 
		(ch. 3) and then extended to a multivariate scenario (ch. 4). In particular:

        	\begin{itemize}

            	\item Chapter 3 focuses on the ability of MI to include not only noise 
			around the prediction but also model (parameters) uncertainty. 
			Bayesian multiple imputation and bootstrap multiple imputation are 
			presented as alternative ways of implementing 
			the “\textbf{predict + noise + parameters uncertainty}” method 
			[see section 3.2.2], and predictive mean matching and classification 
			and regression trees are discussed as well.

            	\item Chapter 4 focuses on multiple imputation techniques that deal with 
			multivariate missing data. The main difference with respect to univariate 
			cases is that multiple patterns of missingness are possible when more 
			variables are missing a value. First, the chapter describes the types of 
			missing data patterns, and describes how to use the MICE package to detect/describe 
			these patterns. Then, it discusses the three main approaches to multivariate 
			missing data imputation: monotone data imputation, joint modelling (\textbf{JM}), 
			and full conditional specification (\textbf{FCS}). FCS is the preferred approach 
			by the book.

        	\end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Analysis} and \textbf{pooling phase} are dealt with in chapter 5.

        \item In chapter 6, \textbf{diagnostic techniques} for multiple imputation are 
		tackled. In particular, great attention is devoted to:

        	\begin{itemize}

            		\item algorithmic convergence diagnostic (section 6.5.2)

            		\item and model fit diagnostic (section 6.6), done according to the concept of 
	    			\textit{distributional discrepancy} between imputed and observed
				data, and performed through the use of diagnostic plots.
        	\end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Dimensionality issues} (p>n) - The text deals with the issue of 
		dimensionality mainly by guiding the researcher through the process of reducing 
		the number of variables to be included in the model (see for example section 9.1 
		and 11.2).
        
    \end{itemize}
